The origins of DFT-FE were in the  [Computational Materials Physics Group](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vikramg)
at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, with Vikram Gavini, Professor of Mechanical Engineering and 
Materials Science & Engineering, as the principal investigator broadly overseeing the effort. The current
development efforts span across the [Computational Materials Physics Group](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vikramg) 
(Prof. Vikram Gavini, Dr. Sambit Das) at the University of Michigan and the [MATRIX lab](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/phanim/) (Prof. Phani Motamarri)
at the Indian Institute of Science.

'DFT-FE authors' is an all encompassing list of contributors to the DFT-FE code. 

DFT-FE code is currently maintained by a group of development leads/mentors and  principal developers, 
who manage the architecture of the code and the core functionalities. Developers with significant contributions
to core functionalities and code architecture in the past who are no longer active principal developers, 
are listed under principal developers emeriti. Finally, all contributors who have contributed to major parts
of the DFT-FE code or sent important fixes and enhancements are listed under contributors. All the underlying 
lists are in alphabetical order based on the last name.
