       treated as delimiters. Default delimiter is space (" ") Examples:
        1. delimiter = " " will use a space as a delimiter
        2. delimiter = ", " will use both comma, space as a delimiter
        @param[in] skipAdjacentDelimiters Boolean to specify whether to merge
       adjacent delimiters. To elaborate, if set to false, then two adjacent
       delimiters will be treated as containing an empty string which will be
       added to the output. If set to true, adjacent delimiters will be treated
       as a single delimiter Default: true
        @param[in] skipLeadTrailWhiteSpace Boolean to specify whether to skip
       any leading and trailing whitespaces. If set to false, leading and
       trailing whitespaces are treated as non-empty strings and included in the
       output. If set to true, leading and trailing whitespaces are not
